✈️ Flight Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning
Accurately Forecasting Air Ticket Prices for Smarter Travel Decisions
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the fare of flight tickets based on historical travel data. The model is trained using features like airline, journey date, departure and arrival times, number of stops, duration, and more. By harnessing the power of data, this project helps users estimate flight fares, optimize travel plans, and potentially save costs.
🔍 Problem Statement
Airfares fluctuate unpredictably due to various factors. Predicting prices in advance can greatly benefit both travelers and travel service platforms. This project demonstrates how data science and ML can be used to solve this real-world regression problem efficiently.
