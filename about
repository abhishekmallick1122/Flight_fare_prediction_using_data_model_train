To create a Flight Fare Prediction model using Excel files for your training and test data, you’d typically follow these steps in a Python-based machine learning workflow. Here’s a comprehensive roadmap:

### 1. **Problem Understanding**
   - Define the objective: Predict flight ticket prices based on features like airline, source, destination, duration, etc.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Use `train.xlsx` and `test.xlsx` files. These should contain relevant columns like:
     - Airline, Source, Destination
     - Date_of_Journey, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time
     - Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info
     - Price (in training data only)

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Read the data** using `pandas`:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     train_data = pd.read_excel('train.xlsx')
     test_data = pd.read_excel('test.xlsx')
     ```
   - **Handle missing values**.
   - **Convert dates and times** to numeric features (e.g., journey day, month, hour).
   - **Encode categorical variables** using techniques like one-hot or label encoding.
   - **Split duration** into hours and minutes.
   - Ensure both train and test sets are processed identically.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand correlations and feature importance.
   - Use visualizations (e.g., with `matplotlib` or `seaborn`) to uncover patterns in data.

### 5. **Feature Selection & Engineering**
   - Create new features from existing ones (e.g., total travel time).
   - Drop irrelevant or redundant columns like Route or Date_of_Journey if they've been decomposed.

### 6. **Model Building**
   - Separate the **features and target**:
     ```python
     X = train_data.drop('Price', axis=1)
     y = train_data['Price']
     ```
   - Choose machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
   - Split train set into train/validation:
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
     ```

### 7. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Fit the model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
     model = RandomForestRegressor()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - Predict and evaluate:
     ```python
     y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
     from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
     print(mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred, squared=False))  # RMSE
     ```

### 8. **Test Set Prediction**
   - Apply the same preprocessing pipeline to `test_data`.
   - Predict:
     ```python
     test_predictions = model.predict(test_data)
     ```

### 9. **Export Results**
   - Save your predictions for submission or analysis:
     ```python
     output = pd.DataFrame({'Prediction': test_predictions})
     output.to_excel('fare_predictions.xlsx', index=False)
     ```

### 10. **Model Tuning (Optional)**
   - Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Try ensemble methods or stacking if needed.
